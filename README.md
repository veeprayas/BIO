The main objective is to look into Text Summarization techniques and its application with-in medical domain. The PubMed database contains more than 34 million citations
and abstracts of biomedical literature, presenting its own set of challenges in cataloguing, distribution, standardising, and qualifying of medical text data. The need for research on biomedical text summarization is twofold. (1) With the increasing volume and variety of data (Medical texts are usually accompanied by
images), along with growing regulation, it becomes important to interpret and summarise data in a fast, secure, and error freeway (2) The medical domain has its own distinct language models, jargon, vocabulary, and abbreviations compared to other domains or general English models. In this project BERT is pretrained and from biomedical summaries data BERT embeddings are extracted and compared with BIO-BERT embeddings and the difference in embeddings for a test data is reported.
